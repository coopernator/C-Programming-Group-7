modifications to header files

int saveFileDatabase(File_t* filep)
int readFileDatabase(File_t* filep)
void modifyAccount(User_t* userHeadp, User_t* currentUserp, int mode)
void modifyFileDetails(User_t* currentUserp, File_t* fileHeadp)
User_t* copyUser(User_t* currentp)




Things people need to change
 - View existing users (function) to print status (admin or normal)
 - make file to add a user section
 - make add file add owner, also make add file check if file is in directory (try to open) before allowing you to ad it
 -"displayFiles()" needs to change the heading to be prettier, and to add owner
 - JONATAN - can you get rid of the clear page plsea


 - Add status (encryptyed, compressed etc) to file??


Functions people need to write
 - Delete own user account
 	- given that there is an admin in the userpLL already

 - File stuff



WORK OUT HOW TO ALLOW CHARACTER ENTERING


REPORT CRAP

	only worked on mac not pc
	login authenticate allowed accepting anything
		change get current user to copy values, rather than just setting adresses equal
		THEN it didn't actually change anything
		So we set the adresses of the values as different, but that didn't work
		ended up making two functions, one to copy, one to make actual current user
	kept crashing when accidentally enter a non int, so turned it all into char
